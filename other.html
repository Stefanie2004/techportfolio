        This was the first project I did this year and was my first time using brackets. I had many issues as well as struggling to understand how to make it. A couple issues I had were naming my watermelon pattern watermelon.patt.patt instead of just one patt so that I entered the wrong code into the AR marker code meaning my AR marker didn’t work and wouldn’t load an image. I now know that I need to look very carefully at what I have done to find any issues because it is easy to make simple mistakes. However, it helped me understand how brackets works and not make simple mistakes.

        This is my 3D text. This is the first work I created on Photoshop not having used the app before. It took a very long time and I had to watch tutorials to create it. The rendering of the text also took many hours to load. Overall I am happy with the outcome of my text.

        The first photos of the flower I took the one on the left with ISO 400 and the one on the right with ISO 1600, as can be seen the image on the left lets in alot more light. Underneath those photos I have photos of Izzie running with two different shutter speeds. The left is 1/500 while the image on the right it is 1/4 which as can be seen makes the image more blurry. The last images of the elephant, I played with the apertue on. The image on the left is F5.6 while the image on the right is F32 making the image on the left focuses just on what was in the foreground which was the elephant while the image on the right is focused on the whole image.
