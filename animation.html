        We had to take a train video and split it into frames and turn it into a rotoscope by tracing around it and adding in our own attributes which weren’t in the video.
        Issues
        were It was a very long process and while colouring in I had to redo a lot of the lines or draw new lines as they weren’t closed properly. The biggest issue was time but also being able to trace in a straight or curved line. I would draw part of the line and then stop and do more so if I went wrong, I wouldn’t have to restart the whole line.

    <div class="text"><strong>This is my dog video</strong> </div>
    <div class="header6">

        I used a video of my dog running towards the water for my rotoscope video. Something new that I added that wasn’t in the video was the clouds and the plane in the sky. I added this to make it look better and more interesting. It also creates another moving object in the rotoscope. I used many different layers to create this design and I also used gradients for the colour of the sky as it was at the time of the sunset. To create the animation I started with my video and then went on premiere pro to split my video footage. On there I had to import the video and export it as separate frames turning it into jpeg images and turning the frame rate to 12. I then drew around all the images in my video. Since the dog is running away from the camera it was very hard after around 65 frames to draw the dog. Adding in the plane was a little hard as I didn’t know exactly where to put it each frame to create a flowing movement and so it wasn’t glitchy. It also had a white background so I had to colour in around it with the colour of the sky.

        This video is of the first work I did on microbit. It starts with a countdown then it shows a flashing heart. I created this on microbit.org.

        This video is me fiddling with the different capabilities of the program. This one is very similar to the other video however it shows text across the screen instead of a countdown.
