        This is my finished image I made a few edits to the past work I had done. I used a starry night sky from space as the background. To create this, I used the rectangle marque select tool as well as the move tool and created a new layer for it. Placing it where I wanted it to be, so that it was covering the sky area around the mountains. I moved around the layers on the side of the photoshop app so that the mountain layer was above the star layer on the side. I did this because it caused the mountains to be the image in front. I then selected the mountain layer grabbed the eraser tool and started erasing the sky above the mountains. Because of layer placement that meant that by erasing the sky, underneath you could see the starry sky and so using the eraser I kept the shapes of the mountains and the starry sky replaced the normal sky. Because I now had the starry sky the hot air balloons were a little too much to have as well and made the picture look very busy and clustered, so I decided it would be better if I didn’t use them in my final design. I am very happy with my end product even though I had to restart and change things through the making of the image to get to it. I am very thankful for the many different layers that I had because without them I would have had to restart numerous times or wouldn’t be able to change my initial idea which changed hugely through the production process.

        This is my Julian Opie Selfie in its production process till the end result. The tools I used when drawing and doing a lot of colouring in were mostly just brush tool, paint brush and bucket tool as well as the eraser. I obviously did not use them as well as I could have because the lines must not have fully met in places so when I went to colour the hair in brown the background and everything else would turn that colour as well. For the last part of my selfie I chose a colour that was as close as I could get to my hair colour and using the brush tool coloured it in making it small at times so that I didn’t cross over lines. I also coloured in my top and blazer using the brush tool and trying to get colours that closely matched the original image. To colour in the background, I chose a colour that I like and using the brush tool and the different sizes of its tip I coloured in around my selfie. My final Julian Opie selfie after making edits to the eyebrows and mouth on the picture before. I was able to make these edits because I had made layers for everything, so I could turn off layers well I fixed others. Colouring in the rest of my portrait I had to use the brush tool, being careful not to draw over lines when colouring and had to be as precise as possible. I learnt from this assignment how to use photoshop tools such as layers, brush tool, paint bucket, eraser and selecting and deselecting parts of the selfie.
